## Design

### Design Choices
The website has been designed choosing a minimal style, similar to the one of old Amiga 500 console template. Everything has been reduced to the bone, to give the taste of how the user interface looked (at least, in the developer's memory, at those times more interested in the actual videogames rather than in the other functionalities of the computer, whose "atmosphere" is still kind of clear).

### Colour
The colours used have been taken directly from several images of the actual Amiga 500 screen I have found on the internet, by using the DevTool eyedropper (or color picker) tool. I discarded only the orangish colour because I didn't find it useful, due to the frugal contents of the website; plus, I thought that it could have given contrast problems for vision impaired users.
I used [Colormind](http://colormind.io/) to represent the main colours used. A part from the general ones, used in the body, in the fonts and in the main div, I included even those of the unflipped cards (where the "Amiga logo" is; the white is not the same white used in elsewhere in the page, and we have a different shade of blue and a grey as well).<br>

*Colours used with their hexadecimal values. They come in two different images because the [Colormind website](http://colormind.io/) only allows 5 colours in a row.*
